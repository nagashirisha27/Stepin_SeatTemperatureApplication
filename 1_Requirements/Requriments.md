## Introduction:
The system showcases a style for any sort of automotive controlled-heating part like seat heating, climate management, defrosting, glow plugs, and tank heaters. The planning consists of a main board and heating part, that represents the resistive heating part found in automotive seat heaters, demonstrating the power to severally management the temperature of every seat further as offer sturdy diagnostics and protection to account for fault events.
## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
-   To record whether the person is seating on the seat or not. 
-   To perform operations that is change in temperature according to the request of the person.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
